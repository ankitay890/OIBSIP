Created multiple project for the Oasis Infobyte Internship
1. Iris Flower Classification: It is a Multiclass Classification problem, to classify flower species based on their sepal and petal diamensions.
   * Algorithm used is Descision Tree.
   * Accuracy achieved is 100%
     
2. Car Price Prediction: It is a Regression problem, where the car price needs to be predicted based on the different features provided about the car
   * Algorithm used is Random Forest.
   * The R-squared and Adj R-squared values are 0.96507 & 0.96411 simultaneously.

3. Sales Prediction: It is a Regression Problem, where the sales amount generated by TV, Newspaper and Radio needs to be predicted.
   * Algorithm used is Linear Regression with the tunning techniques like RIDGE and LASSO.
   * All the algorithm gave the R-squared value close to 0.83, Adj R-squared value 0.83.
   * The lowest RMSE was found = 2.583151427 for LASSO
